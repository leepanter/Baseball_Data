## BASEBALL RAW DATA FILE DESCRIPTIONS

Hey group!

I have created this repository so that we can share some of the data ideas we have regarding Project #2 for Machine Learning.

I have uploaded a file with data downloaded from Sean Lahman's database on Baseball statistics (link provided below).  There are lots of files on MLB baseball with lots of stats.  Take a look and see what you think.
